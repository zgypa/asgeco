# Starter current drop measurements

CSV raw data that shows how the current drops after the engine is started.

[The data](starter_current.csv) shows the engine starts. The first start is with a cold engine. I have kept the starter going for 3 seconds on the third start. You can see how, as soon as the engine starts, the current drops. From this data i can deduce that a good threshold to consider the engine started is 50A.
